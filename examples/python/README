Minimalist VTK-based python TTK example pipeline, including:
-# The computation of a persistence curve
-# The computation of a persistence diagram
-# The selection of the most persistent pairs of the diagram
-# The pre-simplification of the data according to this selection
-# The computation of the Morse-Smale complex on this simplified data
-# The storage of the output of this pipeline to disk.

This example reproduces the Figure 1 of the TTK companion paper:

To run this example, either install TTK using Conda (Linux and OSX) or manually install TTK on your system.

Using Conda
===========
0) Install either miniconda (https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) or 
   anaconda (https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) on your system.

1) Create a conda environment and install the 'topologytoolkit' package from conda-forge:
$ conda create -n ttk
$ conda activate ttk
$ conda install -c conda-forge topologytoolkit

2) From the current directory, enter the following command (omit the '$' character):
$ ./example.py ../data/inputData.vtu


Manual Installation
===================
First install TTK on your system (https://topology-tool-kit.github.io/installation.html).

Next, before launching the script, make sure that you properly define the following environment variables:
- PYTHONPATH (where TTK VTK python modules are installed)

For instance, under Linux, with Python 3.8, this can be done as follows, assuming that you installed ParaView and TTK to /usr/local:
$ export PYTHONPATH="/usr/local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/"

Then, from the current directory, enter the following command (omit the '$' character):
$ ./example.py ../data/inputData.vtu
