Minimalist VTK-based TTK example pipeline, including:
-# The computation of a persistence curve
-# The computation of a persistence diagram
-# The selection of the most persistent pairs of the diagram
-# The pre-simplification of the data according to this selection
-# The computation of the Morse-Smale complex on this simplified data
-# The storage of the output of this pipeline to disk.

This example reproduces the Figure 1 of the TTK companion paper:
"The Topology ToolKit",

Then, from the current directory, enter the following commands (omit the '$' 
character):

```
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ../ 
$ make
```

2) To run this example, from the current directory, enter the following command
(omit the '$' character):

```
