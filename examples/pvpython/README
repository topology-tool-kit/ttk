Minimalist ParaView-based python TTK example pipeline, including:
-# The computation of a persistence curve
-# The computation of a persistence diagram
-# The selection of the most persistent pairs of the diagram
-# The pre-simplification of the data according to this selection
-# The computation of the Morse-Smale complex on this simplified data
-# The storage of the output of this pipeline to disk.

This example reproduces the Figure 1 of the TTK companion paper:
"The Topology ToolKit", 
J. Tierny, G. Favelier, J. Levine, C. Gueunet, M. Michaux.,

To run this example, first install TTK on your system 
(https://topology-tool-kit.github.io/installation.html).

Next, before launching the script, make sure that you properly define the following environment variables:
- PV_PLUGIN_PATH (where TTK ParaView plugins are installed)
- PYTHONPATH (where ParaView python modules are installed)

For instance, under Linux, with Python 3.8, this can be done as follows, assuming that you installed ParaView and TTK to /usr/local:
$ export PV_PLUGIN_PATH="/usr/local/bin/plugins/"
$ export PYTHONPATH="/usr/local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/"

Then, from the current directory, enter the following command (omit the '$' character):
$ ./example.py ../data/inputData.vtu

Alternatively, you can also use the ParaView python wrapper (which will automatically position environment variables correctly):
$ pvpython example.py ../data/inputData.vtu
